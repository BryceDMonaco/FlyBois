Fly Boys is a 3D mobile game where a player controls a plane, modeled after the famous WWII P-51 Mustang. The player can either play a time trials-style game mode, where they attempt to complete a certain amount of laps around the map in the fastest time, or a target-destruction-style game mode where they attempt to destroy the most targets in a set amount of time.

In development by [Bryce Monaco](https://github.com/BryceDMonaco) as a pet project, with some work being done as part of a class on game development on embedded systems (a smartphone for this project).
